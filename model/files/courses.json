  "description": "This course introduces essential practical modeling languages, including Petrinetze and key diagram types in UML such as class diagrams, object diagrams, activity diagrams, and state diagrams. Students will learn to visually and mathematically analyze specific diagrams of these languages to identify properties, correct errors, and supplement subsequent steps in dynamic behavior. They can determine the relationships between instances of different diagram types through the application of semantics or presented algorithms, and use modeling techniques to analyze real-world scenarios and create models.",

Based on Boolean algebra, students will learn to distinguish the use of 0 and 1 in basic methods of switching algebra for minimizing logical expressions, the application of binary codes in arithmetic processing, representation coding, and the control of functions in computer construction. The design of digital circuits (combinational and sequential) is derived from the understanding of truth tables and characteristic equations of flip-flops. The fundamentals of automata theory lead to microprogramming. Finally, the realization of complex functions required for computer construction is introduced and discussed.",

In the second half of the course, students will learn the essential concepts and methods of linear algebra, including vector spaces, subspaces, bases, dimensions, and linear mappings. These knowledge are applied in matrix calculus and solving linear equation systems.
