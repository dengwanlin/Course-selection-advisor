        "Course_Description": "Learning Analytics has attracted a great deal of attention as practitioners, institutions, and researchers are increasingly seeing the potential that LA has to shape the future technology-enhanced learning landscape. LA is an emerging data science field that represents the application of big data and analytics in education. It deals with the development of methods that harness educational data sets to support the learning process. LA is an interdisciplinary field involving competences from computer science, cognitive psychology, and pedagogy. It leverages various computer science methods. These include statistics, big data, machine learning, data/text mining, information visualization, visual analytics, and recommender systems. The first part of the course will provide a systematic overview on this emerging field and its key concepts through a reference model for LA based on four dimensions, namely data, environments, context (what?), stakeholders (who?), objectives (why?), and methods (how?). In the second part of this courses, we will discuss various methods and techniques required to develop innovative LA systems, in relation to each dimension of the LA reference model. In the last part of the course, current topics and trends in LA research will be presented and discussed in invited talks. The presented methods and technologies will be further investigated and applied in small student projects carried out throughout the course. The course topics will include:\n\nLearning analytics and related areas (e.g. educational data mining)\nA reference model for learning analytics\nBig Data (Hadoop ecosystem)\nLearner modeling\nEthics and privacy in learning analytics\nAssessment and feedback\nMachine Learning / Data Mining (classification, clustering, association rule mining)\nRecommender systems\nInformation visualisation and visual analytics\nSocial Network Analysis\nCurrent topics in learning analytics (invited lectures)",

Even relatively small systems, consisting of multiple interacting components, can exhibit very complex behavior. Additionally, one encounters phenomena and problems (deadlocks, mutual exclusion) that cannot occur in sequential systems. Therefore, this lecture will cover relevant modeling techniques and analysis methods to improve the understanding of such systems. The following topics are expected to be covered:\n\n- Transition systems\n- Behavioral equivalences: language equivalence, bisimulation\n- Process calculi – CCS\n- Petri nets (partial order techniques)\n- Graph transformation systems",

These include extensions of Web standards, Web toolkits and development environments, current backend Web frameworks (e.g. Node/Express, Flask), frontend Web frameworks (e.g. Angular, React), and combination of different Web technologies (e.g. MEAN/MERN Stack, Dash). This course follows a student-centered and project-based learning approach. Web technologies will be presented in the lecture by student groups. The presented technologies are further investigated and applied in hands-on sessions as well as small student projects carried out throughout the course.\n\nPrerequisites:\n- Knowledge of basic Web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is required\n- Knowledge of Python is helpful\n- High motivation and commitment\n- Good teamwork skills",

These can be analyzed if we allow non-complete methods. The requirement is that these analysis methods never consider a faulty program as correct, although rejecting correct programs is permissible (one-sided error). In this way, a large number of programs can still be analyzed, and their correctness verified. Another important application area is program optimization in compiler construction.\n\nThe lecture will particularly cover the following topics:\n\n- Data flow analysis (Fixed-point theory, Monotone frameworks, Worklist algorithm, Application examples: Compiler construction, Java Bytecode Verifier)\n- Basics of abstract interpretation (Galois connections, Safe approximation of functions, Abstraction refinement)\n\nTools\nThe following tools will be used in the lecture:\n\n- PAG/WWW (Program analysis generator with WWW interface)\n- jasmin (Assembler for Java bytecode)",

Starting with a brief introduction on the data generation processes, the visualization pipeline, data structures, mapping techniques, and special rendering techniques for scientific data will be discussed. Various examples will be given to outline the benefits of visualization techniques in practical applications. A particular focus is put on interactive methods using GPU-based techniques. Topics include:\n\n- History of Visualization Methods, from ancient wall paintings to GPU accelerated rendering\n- Data Sources\n- Simulation: basics of finite element discretization to GPU-based methods\n- Measurements: physical details of computed tomography to accelerated reconstruction\n- Data Representation: interpolation techniques, from data to meshes\n- Filtering: various filtering methods and their hardware acceleration\n- Scalar Volumes\n- The basics of direct volume rendering\n- GPU accelerated volume rendering I: slicing and ray-casting\n- GPU accelerated volume rendering II: ray guided volume rendering and out-of-core techniques\n- Indirect volume rendering\n- Unstructured data\n- Flow Visualization\n- Glyph based methods\n- Geometric methods\n- GPU-based particle tracing\n- Texture-based methods I: LIC\n- Texture-based methods II: Explicit Frequency Control\n- Feature based methods\n- Visualization methods for Virtual Reality",
